# Kubar

## Overview

Kubar is a quick command line tool to dump and replay the state of a Kubernetes cluster. It is mainly useful in the cases when there is a need to replicate the environment on a different cluster or for migrations.

Note: This targets stateless applications running on Kubernetes clusters and does not support volume snapshotting (you'd have to do that manually yourself).
